This folder contains a function for computing the dynamical contour indices of facial landmarks based on horizontal lines, which named 'FittingIndicesPlus' in './fit_indices.py' file. We also attach the corresponding data('./parallel.txt').

According to the practical situation, you can use this function to replace the function 'CalculateLandmark2D' in the '../cariface.py' file.

For reference, you can also visualize './parallel.txt' on the template face('../toy_example/mean_face.obj') and adjust them by Blender, OpenFlipper or other softwares.

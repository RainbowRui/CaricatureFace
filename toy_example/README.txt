Based on OpenMesh and Numpy, this folder contains a toy example for:
recovering 3D face from vertices (vertex_to_mesh.py),
obtaining vertices of the 3D face (mesh_to_vertex.py).
--------------------------------------------------------------------
'mean_face.obj' is the mean face used by our method.
